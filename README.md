# Coding Challenge for Waterdrop Microdrinks GmbH

This is a showcase project for Waterdrop Microdrinks GmbH for my job search in 2021

Original Description:

> Provide an Android application consisting of 2 screens.
> 
> ## Screen 1:
> Allows to consume an api endpoint of your choice. The screen should have some form of input
> component (can be a picker, textfield or something else) in order to be able to modify the api
> request and a button to execute the api request.
> Example: myapi.com/itemlist?catergory=X
> Loaded data should then be displayed in a list on this screen (you can choose how much
> information you show of each item). Selecting a list item should navigate to screen 2.
>
> ## Screen 2:
> Displays selected items data and additionally allows to take a photo. Once a photo is taken it
> should be displayed on this screen as well. Lastly this screen offers the possibility to store the
> item data + the image on the device.
> * The ui is not the essential part of this assignment, you can make it look pretty though
> * If you make any assumptions, please write them down somewhere
> * If you donâ€™t know an api, we would suggest using the free api from openewheatermap.org
> * Please provide the full source code in a zip file or host it on GitHub and provide the url
